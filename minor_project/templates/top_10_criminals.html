      <p>मानव सभ्यता की शुरुआत से ही अपराध एक विकट समस्या रही है और इस समस्या से निपटने के 
        लिए मनुष्य के प्रयास आंशिक रूप से ही सफल हुए हैं। शायद ही कोई समाज हो जो अपराध और
         अपराध की समस्या से ग्रस्त न हो। जैसा कि एमिल दुर्खीम ने ठीक ही कहा है, अपराध एक प्राकृतिक 
         घटना है जो सामाजिक परिवर्तन के साथ लगातार बदल रही है।
      </p>
      <p>अपराध के कारण के संबंध में अपराधियों के विचार हमेशा अलग-अलग रहे हैं। महाद्वीपीय अपराधी 
        अक्सर अपराध के अंतर्जात सिद्धांत का समर्थन करते हैं जो अपराधियों के जैव-भौतिक विचार पर स्थापित 
        होता है। दूसरी ओर, अमेरिकी अपराधी सामाजिक कारकों के संदर्भ में आपराधिकता की व्याख्या करने के 
        लिए अधिक इच्छुक हैं।
      </p>
      <p>अपराध समाज का एक ऐसा हिस्सा है जिसने हर बार सुरक्षा बलों और सरकार को व्यस्त रखा है। अपराधियों के 
        आंतरिक हमलों से भारत और भारतीयों को बहुत नुकसान हुआ है, लेकिन हमारे सुरक्षाबलों ने हमेशा हमें अपराधियों से बचाया है।
      </p>
      <p>कुछ को गिरफ्तार किया गया है और दंडित किया गया है, लेकिन कुछ बचाव के रास्ते से भागने में सफल रहे हैं और 
        अभी भी दुनिया के किसी न किसी हिस्से में छिपे हुए हैं। भारत अभी भी उन अपराधियों की तलाश करता है, लेकिन कुछ ही
         प्राथमिकता की सूची में शीर्ष पर हैं। तो आज हम भारत के टॉप 10 मोस्ट वांटेड अपराधियों के बारे में चर्चा करेंगे।

      <!-- Crime has been a baffling problem ever since the dawn of human civilization and man’s efforts to grapple with this problem have only partially succeeded. There is hardly any society which is not beset with the problem of crime and criminality. As rightly pointed out by Emile Durkheim, crime is a natural phenomenon which is constantly changing with the social change.            Criminologists have always differed in their views regarding crime causation. Continental criminologists often support the endogenous theory of criminality which is founded on bio-physical consideration of criminals. The American criminologists on the other hand, are more inclined to explain criminality in terms of social factors.           Crime is a part of society that has kept the security forces and the government busy every time. India and Indians have suffered a lot from internal attacks from criminals, but our security forces have always saved us from criminals.          Some have been arrested and punished but few managed to escape through the loopholes and are still hidden in some or the other parts of the world. India still searches for those criminals, but few are top on the list of priority. So today, we will discuss the Top 10 Most Wanted Criminals of India. -->
